## Overview

Chase is a project/sprint management app that was inspired by Notion's Kanban. This project was made so that I can practice my current tech stack, and the new technologies that I've been wanting to learn. Here are the following tech stack for this project:

- ReactJS
- Context API
- React Router
- styled-components
- Firebase/Firestore
